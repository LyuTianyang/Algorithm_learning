The intra-group reverse order adjustment problem of K nodes:
Given a head node head of a singly linked list, and a positive number k
Realize the internal reversal of the group of k nodes, if the last group is not enough k, it will not be adjusted
example: 
Before adjustment: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8, k = 3
After adjustment: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8

The problem of adding two linked lists
Given the head nodes head1 and head2 of two linked lists,
Think that from left to right is a number from low to high, return the linked list after adding
Example 4 -> 3 -> 6 2 -> 5 -> 3
returns 6 -> 8 -> 9
Explanation 634 + 352 = 986

Merge of two sorted linked lists
Given the head nodes head1 and head2 of two ordered linked lists,
Return the large linked list after the merge, the requirements are still in order
Example 1 -> 3 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3-> 7
returns 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 3 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7
