1. Bubble Sort
Compare adjacent elements. If the first is bigger than the second, swap them both.
Do the same for each pair of adjacent elements, from the first pair at the beginning to the last pair at the end. After this step, the last element will be the largest number.
Repeat the above steps for all elements except the last one.
Keep repeating the above steps for fewer and fewer elements each time, until there are no pairs of numbers to compare.

2. Selection Sort
First find the smallest (largest) element in the unsorted sequence and store it at the beginning of the sorted sequence.
Continue to find the smallest (largest) element from the remaining unsorted elements and place it at the end of the sorted sequence.
Repeat step 2 until all elements are sorted.

3.Insertion Sort
The first element of the first to-be-sorted sequence is regarded as an ordered sequence, and the second to the last element is regarded as an unsorted sequence.
Scans the unsorted sequence from beginning to end, inserting each element scanned into the appropriate position of the sorted sequence.
