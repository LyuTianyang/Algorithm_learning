Recursive and non-recursive implementations of merge sort

In an array, the sum of the numbers to the left of a number that is smaller than it is called the small sum of the numbers
The small sum of all numbers is accumulated, called the array small sum
Example: [1,3,4,2,5]
Number less than 1 to the left of 1: no
Number to the left of 3 less than 3: 1
Numbers smaller than 4 to the left of 4: 1, 3
Number to the left of 2 less than 2: 1
Numbers to the left of 5 smaller than 5: 1, 3, 4, 2
So the small sum of the array is 1+1+3+1+1+3+4+2=16
Given an array arr, find the small sum of the arrays

In an array, any preceding number a, and any one following number b, if (a, b) is in descending order, is called a descending pair
Given an array arr, find the total number of pairs in descending order of the array

In an array, for any number num, find how many (the latter number * 2) are still < num, and return the total number
For example: [3,1,7,0,2]
3 is followed by: 1, 0
1 is followed by: 0
7 is followed by: 0, 2
nothing after 0
no after 2
So there are 5 in total
