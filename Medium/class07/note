Heap-related interview questions, strengthening the heap structure

Line segment maximum coincidence problem

Enhanced heap implementation

topic:

Given a number of line segments, each with two numbers [start, end],
Indicates the start position and end position of the line segment, both left and right are closed intervals
Regulation:
1) The start and end positions of the line segments must be integer values
2) The length of the overlapping area of the line segments must be >= 1
Returns the most overlapping area of line segments, including several line segments

Strengthen the implementation of heap, pay attention to analysis

Do a heap-enhancing problem, given an array of integers, int[] arr; and an array of booleans, boolean[] op
The two arrays must be the same length, assuming the length is N, arr[i] represents the customer number, and op[i] represents the customer operation
arr= [3,3,1,2,1,2,5…
op = [T,T,T,T,F,T,F…
In turn means:
3 The user purchased an item
3 The user purchased an item
1 user purchased an item
2 The user purchased an item
1 user returned an item
2 The user purchased an item
5 A user has returned an item…
A pair of arr[i] and op[i] represents an event:
The user ID is arr[i], and op[i] == T means that the user purchased a product
op[i] == F means the user has returned an item
Now that you are the person in charge of the e-commerce platform, you want to
Awards are given to the top K users with the most purchases.
So after each event, you need a list of winners (winners).
Rules of the winning system:
1. If the number of items purchased by a user is 0, but a return event occurs again,
     Then the event is considered invalid, and the list of winners is consistent with the previous event. In the example, the 5 users
2. When a user purchases an item, the number of items purchased is +1, and a return event occurs, and the number of items purchased is -1
3. At most K users will win each time, and K is also the incoming parameter
      If according to all the rules, the number of winners is indeed not enough K, then the result will be output in the case of not enough
4. The winning system is divided into winning area and candidate area. As long as the number of purchases > 0 by any user,
      must be in one of these two areas
5. The top K users with the largest number of purchases will enter the winning area.
      If the winning area does not reach K users at the beginning, the new users will directly enter the winning area
6. If the number of purchases is not enough to enter the winning area, enter the candidate area
7. If the users with the most purchases in the candidate area are enough to enter the winning area,
     The user will replace the user with the least number of purchases in the winning area (more than can be replaced),
     If there are multiple users with the least number of purchases in the winning area, replace the user who entered the winning area first
     If there are multiple users with the most purchases in the candidate area, the opportunity will be given to the user who enters the candidate area first
8. The candidate area and the winning area are two sets of time.
     Because the user will only be in one of the areas, there will only be time in one area, and the other will not
     For users who come out of the winning area and enter the candidate area, the time in the winning area will be deleted.
     The time to enter the candidate area is the time of the current event (which can be understood as i in arr[i] and op[i])
     For users who come out of the candidate area and enter the winning area, the time in the candidate area will be deleted.
     The time to enter the winning area is the time of the current event (which can be understood as i in arr[i] and op[i])
9. If a user's purchase number == 0, he leaves no matter which area he is in, and the area time is deleted.
     Leaving means leaving completely, and the user will not be found in any area
     If the user purchases again next time, the number of purchases > 0 will be generated,
     It will return to an area again according to the previous rules, and the time to enter the area will be re-recorded
Please traverse the arr array and op array, traverse each step and output a list of winners
