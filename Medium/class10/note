Linked list related interview questions (continued), common traversal of binary trees

The intersection node series problem of singly linked list

A seemingly efficient but actually funny way to delete nodes

Inorder, preorder, postorder traversal of binary tree

topic:

Given two singly linked lists that may or may not be cyclic, head nodes head1 and head2
Please implement a function that, if two linked lists intersect, return the first node that intersects. Returns null if disjoint
It is required that if the sum of the lengths of the two linked lists is N, the time complexity should reach O(N), and the additional space complexity should reach O(1)

Can you delete this point on the linked list by not giving the head node of the singly linked list, but only the node you want to delete?
