Enter the head node of the linked list, the odd length returns the midpoint, and the even length returns the upper midpoint
Enter the head node of the linked list, the odd length returns the midpoint, and the even length returns the lower midpoint
Enter the head node of the linked list, the odd-numbered length returns the one before the midpoint, and the even-numbered length returns the one before the upper midpoint
Enter the head node of the linked list, the odd-numbered length returns the one before the midpoint, and the even-numbered length returns the one before the lower midpoint

Given the head node head of a singly linked list, please determine whether the linked list is a palindrome

Given a head node head of a singly linked list, given an integer n, divide the linked list into left < n, middle == n, right > n according to n

A special singly linked list node class is described as follows
class Node {
int value;
Node next;
Node rand;
Node(int val) { value = val; }
}
The rand pointer is a newly added pointer in the singly linked list node structure, rand may point to any node in the linked list, or it may point to null
Given a head node head of an acyclic singly linked list consisting of Node node types, please implement a function to complete the replication of the linked list
Returns the head node of the copied new linked list, requiring time complexity O(N) and additional space complexity O(1)
